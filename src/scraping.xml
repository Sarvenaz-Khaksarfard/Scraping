Follow your friends and family to see what they’re up to, and discover accounts from all over the world that are sharing things you love. Join the community of over 500 million people and express yourself by sharing all the moments of your day––the highlights and everything in between, too. Use Instagram to: • Post photos and videos you want to keep on your profile grid. Edit them with filters and creative tools and combine multiple clips into one video. • Share multiple photos and videos (as many as you want!) to your story. Bring them to life with text and drawing tools. They disappear after 24 hours and won't appear on your profile grid or in feed. • Go live to connect with your friends and followers right now. When you're done, live stories disappear. • Send disappearing photos and videos, text messages and posts from your feed to groups and friends with Instagram Direct. • Watch stories and live videos from the people you follow in a bar at the top of your feed. • Discover stories, photos and videos you might like and follow new accounts on the Explore tab.</Description><Rate>4.5</Rate><Reviews>48,152,991</Reviews><Rate_Scores><Five>34,363,817</Five><Four>8,230,396</Four><Three>2,730,251</Three><Two>948,978</Two><One>1,879,549</One></Rate_Scores><Changes>New Direct: Disappearing photos and videos will now appear alongside text messages and reshared posts, so you can seamlessly go back and forth with friends in the same thread.

Over 100 million active users in two and a half years. FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe. SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again. UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 5,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork. RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs. SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use. 100% FREE &amp; NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees. PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data. For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.
